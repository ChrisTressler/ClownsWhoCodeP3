# In order to run this program, you have two options:

The first is to create a project in CLion. The images folder should be placed within the cmake-debug folder and you must use the specified CMAkelists.txt file.

The second is to install CMake and run the cmake command to create a proper makefile (MingGW Makefiles). 

To run the program, the image files MUST be in an image folder off the default directory. The UniStudentData.csv file must be in the same directory as the source files.
