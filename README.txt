# In order to run this program, you have two options:

The first is to create a project in CLion. The images folder should be placed within the cmake-debug folder and you must use the specified CMAkelists.txt file. The CSV file should also be within the cmake-debug folder.

The second is to install CMake and run the cmake command to create a proper makefile (MingGW Makefiles). You can then run the program through a terminal.

To run the program, the image files MUST be in an image folder off the default directory. The UniStudentData.csv file must be in the same directory as the source files.
